    conda install -c conda-forge castorapi

But, you can also install using pip (https://pypi.org/project/castorapi/):

## Example code
    import castorapi as ca
    c = ca.CastorApi('/path/to/folder/with/secret_client')
    c.select_study_by_name('<CASTOR_STUDY_NAME>') # all following commands use this study selection
    stats = c.request_statistics()
    print(stats)
    df_study, df_structure_study, df_report, df_structure_report, df_optiongroups_structure = c.records_reports_all()
    users_in_study = c.request_studyuser()
    print(users_in_study)
    
    # Getting data from castor about patients in a study
    c.request_study_records(record_id='CASTOR00010')
    
    # Posting data to castor to create a new patient
    # add institute_id and , request_method='POST' to use this functionality.
    c.request_study_records(record_id='CASTOR00010', institute_id=<instituteID>, request_method='POST')

## Known issues
1. The documentation is sparse. Feel free to contribute.
2. Not all Castor API functions are implemented (I implement them on a need-to-use basis), feel free to contribute.
3. See https://github.com/wouterpotters/castorapi/issues for an overview of all open issues.

## NOTE
I am not affiliated with Castor EDC in any way. Use this software at your own risk.
If this API tool does not suffice - take a look at the work from Reinier van Linschoten, who also created a Python package for two-way communication Castor EDC (2021). (https://github.com/reiniervlinschoten/castoredc_api)
